Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller subarrays, sorts each subarray, and then merges them back together in sorted order.
It ensures stable sorting with a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets.
This example demonstrates the recursive splitting and merging of the array.
